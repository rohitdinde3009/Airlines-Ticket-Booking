          <p>Designed by American architect Melton Bekker, this luxury hotel in Mumbai opened its door 
            to guests in 1973, instantly carving an identity into the cityscape. Bekker incorporated Indian
             design elements like Tanjore pillars from the south and arched balconies from 14th century imperial
              Rajasthan into the distinctive tower which is crowned with a jagged diadem. Four decades since, our
               5 star hotel in Colaba continues to dazzle patrons with luxurious suites, iconic restaurants and sublime 
               views of the city’s famed seafront. As a guest at the Taj Mahal Tower, you’re privy to world-class sophistication
                and impeccable service underscored by Mumbai’s warmth and vigour. Our location in the heritage district of Colaba 
                keeps you at the city’s nerve centre of art, culture and glamour. Should you choose to venture further, our concierge 
                desk curates signature experiences that let you unravel the megalopolis’s multifaceted layers. Whether relaxing in your
                 well-appointed suite, luxuriating at the spa or exploring Mumbai’s many alternative lives by the docks, the Taj
                  hospitality assures you have a splendid time
